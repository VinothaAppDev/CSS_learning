Here are short and clear notes for your CSS code using element and pseudo-class selectors:

***

### CSS Element and `:nth-child` Pseudo-class

- `section { color: blue; }`  
  - Colors all text inside `<section>` blue.

- `p:nth-child(3) { color: brown; }`  
  - Selects the `<p>` that is the 3rd child of its parent.  
  - Here, it colors the second `<p>` inside `<section>` brown because it is the third child of `<section>` (after the `<h1>` and first `<p>`).

- Use `:nth-child(n)` to style elements based on their position within parent.

***

This explanation highlights the key usage of pseudo-class `:nth-child` and element styling together.

why the a tag haven;t inherited its parent style
------------------------------------------------

The reason the <a> tag hasn’t inherited its parent’s style (like color) is because some CSS properties are not automatically inherited by certain elements such as links.

Browsers apply default styles to anchor tags (<a>)—usually a blue color and underline—which override the parent’s styles unless explicitly overridden. This is why the link may appear in its default style, ignoring the parent's color.

To make an anchor inherit the parent's color, you can explicitly set:

css
a {
  color: inherit;
  text-decoration: inherit; /* or none */
}
Key points:

CSS inheritance applies only to inheritable properties.

Links have default browser styles that take precedence unless overridden.

Use color: inherit; on the <a> tag to force inheritance from the parent.

Other properties like font-family, color, and line-height are inherited by default, but text-decoration is usually not.

This explains why <a> tags often need explicit styling to inherit parent styles.​​
